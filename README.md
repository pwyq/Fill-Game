# Fill-Game

[![build](https://github.com/pwyq/Fill-Game/actions/workflows/c-cpp.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/pwyq/Fill-Game/actions/workflows/c-cpp.yml)

Fill-Game is a two-player (adversarial) version of [Fillomino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fillomino). It is (probably) first proposed by [Dr. Martin MÃ¼ller](https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~mmueller/); if so; this software is the first for Fill-Game.

## Functions & Goals

- [x] Local play
    - [x] Two human players
    - [x] Human vs. AI player
- [ ] Cross-machine play
- [x] Cross-platform deployment

### Algorithms

- Proof Number Search (PNS)
- Depth-First Proof Number Search (DFPN)
- Minimax (with alpha-beta pruning and transposition table)
- Negamax (with alpha-beta pruning and transposition table)

## Build

To build with GUI (requires set up Qt5.12.8)

```bash
./linux_build.sh --gui
```

To build without GUI

```bash
./linux_build.sh
```

### Run

Start GUI version

```bash
./fillgame_gui
```

Start CLI version

```bash
./fillgame_cli <game-board-string> <time-limit>
```

To run unittests for algorithms

```bash
./test_main
```

To run experiments

```bash
./run_experiments.sh
```

## Development

- Ubuntu 22.04 / WSL2
- VS Code / CLion
- C++ 20
- GUI Framework: Qt5
- Unit test: [Google Test](https://github.com/google/googletest)
- Formatter: clang-format-12
- Profiler: Valgrind, kcachegrind

### Guide
- Follows [Google C++ Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html)
- Profiler: `valgrind --tool=callgrind ./(Your binary)` && `kcachegrind callgrind.out.x`
