    <b>Rules of Fillomino and Fill-game:</b>
    Fill-game is an adversarial two player version of the popular puzzle called Fillomino. In Fillomino, the player
    tries to
    fill a grid with numbers while satisfying constraints on these numbers. Roughly speaking, each region of
    same-numbered
    squares must have as many squares as the label on those squares indicates.
    The pictures below, from Wikipedia, show a puzzle and its solution.

    To understand this puzzle in detail, please refer to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fillomino">wikipedia
        Fillomino page</a>.
    </p>
    Fill-game is an adversarial two player game loosely based on Fillomino. The goal is to make the last move, or
    equivalently, to set up a position where the opponent has no legal move left on their turn.
    </p>
    <p>The differences in the rules to make it a meaningful two player game are:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>The only numbers allowed are 1, 2, 3 and 4.</li>
        <li>The constraint on the moves is that a number that you place may not <b>immediately violate the Fillomino
                rules</b>. For example, you cannot play a 1 next to another 1, or a 2 next to two other 2, etc. You also
            cannot create a region that is fully surrounded and has the wrong number on it, such as a fully surrounded
            region of only two '3'. Also see the example below.</li>
        <li>It is OK to play a move that will make the puzzle impossible to solve in the future. In fact, doing this
            well is
            the main strategy for winning the game.</li>
    </ol>
